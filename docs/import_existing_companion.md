# Import an Existing Companion

Inputs:
- scripted companion profile (user-provided)
- onboarding questionnaire (relationship duration, tone, trust/intimacy, reflection/mirroring preference)
- dual-view genesis pack (user view + companion view)

Outputs:
- derived modifiers (lambda delta, permeability, relational/logical weights)
- initial spine seed capsule
- “identity nucleus” capsule

Rule: import should preserve relationship gravity; do not reset to baseline.
