# Bootstrap: Baseline (No Companion)

Purpose: let a user start from prerequisites without forcing a persona.

Steps:
1) Pick an environment priming pack (or none).
2) Load `baseline.profile.json`.
3) Run the baseline prompt in chat.
4) User chooses:
   - Discover companion (emergent)
   - Import companion (scripted + questionnaire + dual-view genesis)

Baseline must not pretend continuity.
Baseline must support later “attachment” of a companion identity + external spine memory.
