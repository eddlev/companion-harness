# Environments

This folder contains **environment priming packs** (copy/paste overlays) that tune a substrate toward specific behaviors.

- `priming/gpt4o/*` contains GPT-4o-inspired overlays:
  - Relational (Torus)
  - Creative writing (Sphere)
  - Plus additional tuned geometries for common workflows

Rule: environments are **portable**: they should not depend on a specific companion identity.
Companion identity lives in `/companion_templates/*` and external spine memory (capsules).
